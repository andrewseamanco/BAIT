                <p>I spent a lot of time kicking around on a piece of ground in my home town right here in
                Littleton Colorado.  I primarily spent the beginning years of my life going to the library, playing 
                hide and seek, and doing other stuff that toddlers do.  Also a fun fact, but I have always 
                struggled with my directions and around this time I discovered that I could read words better backwards 
                than I could forewards.  These two character quirks are why I ended up spelling my name 
                Anbrew for a very long time! </p>

            <p> I attended Elementary School at All Souls Catholic School.  In order to make sure that we 
            had school spirit, our mascot was the spirits!  Yep you heard it here, the All Souls Spirits. 
            While at All Souls I learned many interesting things like where to sit during indoor recess so I 
            could make it to the computer first to play video games, the reasons that being a monk probably is 
            not for me while we listened to Gregorian monk chanting to <a href="https://www.catholic.org/lent/abfast.php"> fast </a> 
            or durability testing while trying to break -- yes I mean shatter -- the (not very well) reheated pancakes by 
            throwing them against the table.

            <h1 id="header">Step 4: Various Activities </h1>
            <p> Around this time my parents were trying to figure out the type of kid that I would be.  To accomplish 
            these ends, my parents enrolled me in a bunch of athletic activities.  Unfortunately, or fortunately because 
            otherwise you would not be reading about the wonders of childhood taekwondo, my cousins had become 
            very invested in taekwondoe before me.  Taekwondo is, at a professional level, a martial arts style that 
            is characterized by fast kicking, head height kicks and other kickass techniques.  However, for third grader 
            American beginners taking lessons from a dojo next to a hair salon, it mostly meant doing "moves" around 
            a square made with duck tape in my basement for a few hours every day.  The only "cool" part if you can really 
            characterize anything that I was doing around that time as cool was breaking through plastic boards.  A fun bonus aside 
            story is in fifth grade - long after I had quit after only achieving a purple belt - my friend got really into 
            taekwondo.  When it came to board breaking the instructor held the board a little bit too high and I punched him 
            in the neck really hard by accident.  That was my last taekwondo experience. </p>

            <h1 id="header">Step 4: Various Activities </h1>
            <p> Since I did not in fact become the Karate (or Taekwondo?) Kid, my parents, inspired by the movie 
            remember the Titans enrolled me in football.  At this time in my life I was definitely not focused on 
            the glory of scoring a touchdown or the thrill of making a really good tackle.  Instead I was mostly 
            just going with the flow - Hukuna Matata style.  Therefore I was the bane of my "football is my life and 
            if this team doesn\'t make it to the fifth grade superbowl I am going to freak out" coach\'s life. 
            I pretty much rode the bench except for the ten minutes [mandatory to appease the parents who paid a ridiculous 
            amount of money for their fifth grader to play D-1 football].  Ironically, during this time I discovered 
            that I was really good at being coached.  Even though I never played, I ended up in the best shape of my young 
            life and was ready to actually play some sports that I enjoyed. </p>
